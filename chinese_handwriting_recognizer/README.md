# Chinese Handwritten Character Recognition : HSK 1
A convolutional neural network that recognizes a hantwritten chinese character out of the 178 characters of the HSK 1 exam with a high accuracy. You do not need to train this model yourself for the chinese handwriting recognizer webapp to work. Download only the [Ul](https://github.com/HitsujiAura/chinese_handwriting_interface) and the [Server](https://github.com/HitsujiAura/chinese_handwriting_server) which contains a pretrained chinese handwriting recognizer model shown in this repository.

## Data
Using the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vitsuji/chinese-handwriting-recognition-hsk-1) provided, an edit of the CASIA Online and Offline Chinese Handwriting Databases with only the 178 characters  featured in the HSK 1 (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi) exam.
