# Chinese Handwriting Server

This is the backend for the [Chinese Handwriting UI](https://github.com/HitsujiAura/chinese_handwriting_interface).

It takes the handwritten character of the user and uses the [machine learning model]() trained before to recognize that character and send it digitally to the frontend.
